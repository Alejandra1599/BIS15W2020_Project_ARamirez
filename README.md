# 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Exploratory Data Analysis


This is the repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus analysis using data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). NCBI Genbank data provided on coronavirus isolation location also supported this analysis.

### Premise

- Provide information about coronavirus prevention and improve literacy
- List resources to reduce anxiety and heightened tentions surrounding coronaviurs
- Explore deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered patients by country and dates February 22, 2020 to March 11,2020

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- This was inspired by the many already created dashboards and infographics present for coronavirus
- Providing information about the nature of the virus and its prevalence in our communities from a social standpoint will allow us to better understand its repercussions and arrange preparations.
